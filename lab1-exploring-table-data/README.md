# Lab 1: Exploring Table Data

## 📘 Overview

This project is part of a data science course focused on exploring tabular datasets and performing initial data analysis. In **Lab 1**, we examine a house rent dataset sourced from MagicBricks.com and hosted on Kaggle. The objective is to understand the structure and relationships within the data and lay the foundation for future modeling tasks.

## 📊 Dataset

**Source**: [Kaggle - House Rent Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/house-rent-prediction-dataset)

The dataset includes various features relevant to rental housing listings across India, including:

- Rent price
- BHK (number of rooms)
- Area (carpet/super/built-up)
- Furnishing status
- City and locality
- Preferred tenant type
- Floor number
- Number of bathrooms

## 🔍 Notebook Contents

The main analysis is contained in [`lab1_exploring_table_data.ipynb`](./lab1_exploring_table_data.ipynb), which includes:

- ✅ Data loading and inspection  
- 📉 Descriptive statistics and visualizations  
- 📦 Categorical variable encoding and cleaning  
- 📌 Observations about the relationships between features and rent  
- 📈 Plot styling for consistent visual presentation

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
