# AI/ML Course Labs (Refreshed)

This repository contains cleaned, commented, and updated versions of 7 AI/ML labs from a university course. Each lab explores foundational machine learning algorithms, implemented in Python and reviewed for continued learning.

## Labs Overview

| Lab | Topic                  | Highlights |
|-----|------------------------|------------|
| 1   | Exploring Table Data      | Analyzing data quality issues |
| 2   | ~~Exploring Image Data Grade Computation~~ [Unrecoverable]   | *Replacing with computer vision personal project*    |
| 3   | Extending Logistic Regression         | Compare logistic regression methods        |
| 4   | The Multi-Layer Perceptron| Implement multi-layer perceptrons        |
| 5   | Wide and Deep Networks   | Evaluate deep learning models and tune hyper params.     |
| 6   | CNNs       | Build and tune deep learning model   |
| 7   | RNNs       |Build and tune recurrent model    |
