# AI/ML Course Labs (Refreshed)

This repository contains cleaned, commented, and updated versions of 6 AI/ML labs from a university course. Each lab explores foundational machine learning algorithms, implemented in Python and reviewed for continued learning.

## Labs Overview

| Lab | Topic                  | Highlights |
|-----|------------------------|------------|
| 1   | Linear Regression      | Manual vs sklearn, loss plots |
| 2   | Logistic Regression    | Binary classifier, ROC/AUC    |
| 3   | Decision Trees         | Gini/Entropy, pruning         |
| 4   | Support Vector Machines| Kernels, margin tuning        |
| 5   | K-Nearest Neighbors    | Distance metrics, scaling     |
| 6   | Neural Networks        | Backprop, activation funcs    |

## Goals
- Revisit and reinforce course material
- Polish and clean up group code
- Improve documentation and explanations

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn, PyTorch (where used)
